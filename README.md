## On Variables

1. In declaring a *variable,* there should not be a space between *the value,* *equal sign* and *the variable name*
This, `myname = "some name"`, is wrong. While `myname="some name" is correct.

2. In order to print the variable name, we use single quotes **' '**. And we use **\** to skip a character.
